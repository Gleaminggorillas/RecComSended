A simple flask application for listing home recipes.

Home page presents a list of available recipes, from a json.

Recipe pages present a dictionary from a json.
    Key is the ingredient
    Value is the required quantity

** Goal is to maintain concision, and elegance; no funny business.

======= TO IMPLEMENT (unordered) =========

--> fix URls, presently unstable.

--> fridge/food storage.
        check on food inventory and potentially subtract food inventory from ingredient requirements on recipes page.

--> convert json files to SQL format.

--> implement CSS and Javascript.
        Aesthetik is needed.

--> Add recipe instructions.

--> Attempt implementing webdrive to auto-purchase from specific stores?
        would also require user accounts, and vast restructuring.
